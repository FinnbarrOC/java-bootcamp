    // 1) OUTPUT: first, we want the computer to show us some text



    // 2) VARIABLES: we can use variables like labeled boxes to hold data for us



    // 3) INPUT: now let's type a message to the computer, save it, and print it back out

    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);



    // 4) MATH: try some simple addition/subtraction, then see how fast your computer really is!
    //          (because we are using integers, answers will be rounded off to whole numbers)
    


    // 3) TYPE CONVERSION: all varibles have fixed types, but we can convert between types if needed



    // 6) CALCULATOR: time to combine everything you've learned to make a simple calculator!
